      SIG Docs is one of the
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md">
        special interest groups
      </a>
      within the Kubernetes project, focused on writing, updating, and maintaining
      the documentation for Kubernetes as a whole. See
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs">
        SIG Docs from the community github repo
      </a>
      for more information about the SIG.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIG Docs welcomes content and reviews from all contributors. Anyone can open a
      pull request (PR), and anyone is welcome to file issues about content or comment
      on pull requests in progress.

      comment to the pull
      request.

      If the assigned reviewer has not yet reviewed the content, another reviewer can
      step in. In addition, you can assign technical reviewers and wait for them to

      SIG Docs chairperson
    </h2>
    <p>
      Each SIG, including SIG Docs, selects one or more SIG members to act as
      chairpersons. These are points of contact between SIG Docs and other parts of
      the Kubernetes organization. They require extensive knowledge of the structure
      of the Kubernetes project as a whole and how SIG Docs works within it. See
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership">
        Leadership
      </a>
      for the current list of chairpersons.

    <h2 id="sig-docs-teams-and-automation">
      SIG Docs teams and automation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Automation in SIG Docs relies on two different mechanisms for automation:
      GitHub groups and OWNERS files.
    </p>
    <h3 id="github-groups">
      GitHub groups
    </h3>
    <p>
      The SIG Docs group defines two teams on GitHub:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-maintainers">
          @kubernetes/sig-docs-maintainers
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-pr-reviews">
          @kubernetes/sig-docs-pr-reviews
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each can be referenced with their
      <code>
        @name
      </code>
      in GitHub comments to communicate with
      everyone in that group.
    </p>
    <p>
      These teams overlap, but do not exactly match, the groups used by the automation
      tooling. For assignment of issues, pull requests, and to support PR approvals,
      the automation uses information from OWNERS files.
    </p>
    <h3 id="owners-files-and-front-matter">
      OWNERS files and front-matter
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Kubernetes project uses an automation tool called prow for automation
      related to GitHub issues and pull requests. The
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website">
        Kubernetes website repository
      </a>
      uses
      two
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/plugins">
        prow plugins
      </a>
      :
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        blunderbuss
      </li>
      <li>
        approve
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These two plugins use the
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS">
        OWNERS
      </a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/OWNERS_ALIASES">
        OWNERS_ALIASES
      </a>
      files in the top level of the
      <code>
        kubernetes/website
      </code>
      GitHub repository to control
      how prow works within the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
      An OWNERS file contains a list of people who are SIG Docs reviewers and
      approvers. OWNERS files can also exist in subdirectories, and can override who
      can act as a reviewer or approver of files in that subdirectory and its
      descendents. For more information about OWNERS files in general, see
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/owners.md">
        OWNERS
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, an individual Markdown file can list reviewers and approvers in its
      front-matter, either by listing individual GitHub usernames or GitHub groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of OWNERS files and front-matter in Markdown files determines
      the advice PR owners get from automated systems about who to ask for technical
      and editorial review of their PR.

    <h2 id="how-merging-works">
      How merging works
    </h2>
    <p>
      When a pull request is merged to the branch used to publish content (currently
      <code>
        master
      </code>
      ), that content is published and available to the world. To ensure that
      the quality of our published content is high, we limit merging pull requests to
      SIG Docs approvers. Here&rsquo;s how it works.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When a pull request has both the
        <code>
          lgtm
        </code>
        and
        <code>
          approve
        </code>
        labels, has no
        <code>
          hold
        </code>
        labels, and all tests are passing, the pull request merges automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kubernetes organization members and SIG Docs approvers can add comments to
        prevent automatic merging of a given pull request (by adding a
        <code>
          /hold
        </code>
        comment
        or withholding a
        <code>
          /lgtm
        </code>
        comment).
      </li>
      <li>
        Any Kubernetes member can add the
        <code>
          lgtm
        </code>
        label by adding a
        <code>
          /lgtm
        </code>
        comment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only SIG Docs approvers can merge a pull request
        by adding an
        <code>
          /approve
        </code>
        comment. Some approvers also perform additional
        specific roles, such as
        <a href="/docs/contribute/advanced#be-the-pr-wrangler-for-a-week">
          PR Wrangler
        </a>
        or
