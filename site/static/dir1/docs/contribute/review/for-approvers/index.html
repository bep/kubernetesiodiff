      and

        Approvers

      do a few extra things when reviewing a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every week a specific docs approver volunteers to triage
      and review pull requests. This
      person is the &ldquo;PR Wrangler&rdquo; for the week. See the
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/PR-Wranglers">
        PR Wrangler scheduler
      </a>
      for more information. To become a PR Wrangler, attend the weekly SIG Docs meeting and volunteer. Even if you are not on the schedule for the current week, you can still review pull
      requests (PRs) that are not already under active review.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the rotation, a bot assigns reviewers and approvers
      for the PR based on the owners for the affected files.

      Everything described in
      <a href="/docs/contribute/review/reviewing-prs">
        Reviewing a pull request

      applies, but Reviewers and Approvers should also do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Using the
        <code>
          /assign
        </code>
        Prow command to assign a specific reviewer to a PR as needed. This is extra important
        when it comes to requesting technical review from code contributors.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Making sure the PR follows the

          Content

      Commit into another person&rsquo;s PR

    <p>
      Leaving PR comments is helpful, but there might be times when you need to commit
      into another person&rsquo;s PR instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not &ldquo;take over&rdquo; for another person unless they explicitly ask
      you to, or you want to resurrect a long-abandoned PR. While it may be faster
      in the short term, it deprives the person of the chance to contribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process you use depends on whether you need to edit a file that is already
      in the scope of the PR, or a file that the PR has not yet touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can&rsquo;t commit into someone else&rsquo;s PR if either of the following things is
      true:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the PR author pushed their branch directly to the
        <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/website/">
          https://github.com/kubernetes/website/
        </a>
        repository. Only a reviewer with push access can commit to another user&rsquo;s PR.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <blockquote class="note">
        <div>
          <strong>
            Note:
          </strong>
          Encourage the author to push their branch to their fork before
          opening the PR next time.

        Prow

      SIG Docs encounters the following types of issues often enough to document how
      to handle them.

    <h3 id="duplicate-issues">
      Duplicate issues
    </h3>
    <p>
      If a single problem has one or more issues open for it, combine them into a single issue.
      You should decide which issue to keep open (or
      open a new issue), then move over all relevant information and link related issues.
      Finally, label all other issues that describe the same problem with
      <code>
        triage/duplicate
      </code>
      and close them. Only having a single issue to work on reduces confusion
      and avoids duplicate work on the same problem.

    <h3 id="dead-link-issues">
      Dead link issues
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the dead link issue is in the API or
      <code>
        kubectl
      </code>
      documentation, assign them
      <code>
        /priority critical-urgent
      </code>
      until the problem is fully understood. Assign all other dead link issues
      <code>
        /priority important-longterm
      </code>
      , as they must be manually fixed.

      We expect
      <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/">
        Kubernetes Blog
      </a>
      entries to become
      outdated over time. Therefore, we only maintain blog entries less than a year old.
      If an issue is related to a blog entry that is more than one year old,
      close the issue without fixing.

    <h3 id="support-requests-or-code-bug-reports">
      Support requests or code bug reports
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some docs issues are actually issues with the underlying code, or requests for
      assistance when something, for example a tutorial, doesn&rsquo;t work.
      For issues unrelated to docs, close the issue with the
      <code>
        triage/support
      </code>
      label and a comment
      directing the requester to support venues (Slack, Stack Overflow) and, if
      relevant, the repository to file an issue for bugs with features (
      <code>
        kubernetes/kubernetes
      </code>
      is a great place to start).

    <pre><code class="language-none" data-lang="none">This issue sounds more like a request for support and less
like an issue specifically for docs. I encourage you to bring
