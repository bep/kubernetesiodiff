      A node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, previously known as a
      <code>
        minion
      </code>
      . A node
      may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains
      the services necessary to run
      <a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/">
        pods
      </a>
      and is managed by the master
      components. The services on a node include the
      <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime">
        container runtime
      </a>
      , kubelet and kube-proxy. See

      <code>

      <a href="/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/">
        kube-controller-manager
      </a>
      ), all the Pods on the node are scheduled for deletion by the Node Controller. The default eviction timeout duration is
      <strong>
        five minutes
      </strong>
      . In some cases when the node is unreachable, the apiserver is unable to communicate with the kubelet on the node. The decision to delete the pods cannot be communicated to the kubelet until communication with the apiserver is re-established. In the meantime, the pods that are scheduled for deletion may continue to run on the partitioned node.
    </p>
    <p>
      In versions of Kubernetes prior to 1.5, the node controller would
      <a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#force-deletion-of-pods">
        force delete
      </a>
      these unreachable pods from the apiserver. However, in 1.5 and higher, the node controller does not force delete pods until it is
      confirmed that they have stopped running in the cluster. You can see the pods that might be running on an unreachable node as being in
      the
      <code>
        Terminating
      </code>
      or
      <code>
        Unknown
      </code>
      state. In cases where Kubernetes cannot deduce from the underlying infrastructure if a node has
      permanently left a cluster, the cluster administrator may need to delete the node object by hand.  Deleting the node object from
      Kubernetes causes all the Pod objects running on the node to be deleted from the apiserver, and frees up their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The node lifecycle controller automatically creates
      <a href="/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/">
        taints
      </a>
      that represent conditions.
      The scheduler takes the Node&rsquo;s taints into consideration when assigning a Pod to a Node.
      Pods can also have tolerations which let them tolerate a Node&rsquo;s taints.

      a node is not inherently created by Kubernetes: it is created externally by cloud
      providers like Google Compute Engine, or it exists in your pool of physical or virtual
      machines. So when Kubernetes creates a node, it creates
      an object that represents the node. After creation, Kubernetes
      checks whether the node is valid or not. For example, if you try to create
      a node from the following content:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{

      Kubernetes creates a node object internally (the representation), and
      validates the node by health checking based on the
      <code>
        metadata.name
      </code>
      field. If the node is valid &ndash; that is, if all necessary
      services are running &ndash; it is eligible to run a pod. Otherwise, it is
      ignored for any cluster activity until it becomes valid.
      The name of a Node object must be a valid

    <p>
      Currently, there are three components that interact with the Kubernetes node
      interface: node controller, kubelet, and kubectl.
    </p>
    <h3 id="node-controller">
      Node Controller
    </h3>
    <p>
      The node controller is a Kubernetes master component which manages various
      aspects of nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The node controller has multiple roles in a node&rsquo;s life. The first is assigning a
      CIDR block to the node when it is registered (if CIDR assignment is turned on).
    </p>
    <p>
      The second is keeping the node controller&rsquo;s internal list of nodes up to date with
      the cloud provider&rsquo;s list of available machines. When running in a cloud
      environment, whenever a node is unhealthy, the node controller asks the cloud
      provider if the VM for that node is still available. If not, the node
      controller deletes the node from its list of nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third is monitoring the nodes&rsquo; health. The node controller is
      responsible for updating the NodeReady condition of NodeStatus to
      ConditionUnknown when a node becomes unreachable (i.e. the node controller stops
      receiving heartbeats for some reason, for example due to the node being down), and then later evicting
      all the pods from the node (using graceful termination) if the node continues
      to be unreachable. (The default timeouts are 40s to start reporting
      ConditionUnknown and 5m after that to start evicting pods.) The node controller
      checks the state of each node every
      <code>
        --node-monitor-period
      </code>
      seconds.
    </p>
    <h4 id="heartbeats">
      Heartbeats
    </h4>
    <p>
      Heartbeats, sent by Kubernetes nodes, help determine the availability of a node.
      There are two forms of heartbeats: updates of
      <code>
        NodeStatus
      </code>
      and the
      <a href="/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.18
/#lease-v1-coordination-k8s-io">
        Lease object
      </a>
      .
      Each Node has an associated Lease object in the
      <code>
        kube-node-lease
      </code>
      <a class='glossary-tooltip' href='/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces' target='_blank'>
        namespace
        <span class='tooltip-text'>
          An abstraction used by Kubernetes to support multiple virtual clusters on the same physical cluster.
        </span>
      </a>
      .
      Lease is a lightweight resource, which improves the performance
      of the node heartbeats as the cluster scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kubelet is responsible for creating and updating the
      <code>
        NodeStatus
      </code>
      and
      a Lease object.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The kubelet updates the
        <code>
          NodeStatus
        </code>
        either when there is change in status,
        or if there has been no update for a configured interval. The default interval
        for
        <code>
          NodeStatus
        </code>
        updates is 5 minutes (much longer than the 40 second default
        timeout for unreachable nodes).
      </li>
      <li>
        The kubelet creates and then updates its Lease object every 10 seconds
        (the default update interval). Lease updates occur independently from the
        <code>
          NodeStatus
        </code>
        updates. If the Lease update fails, the kubelet retries with exponential backoff starting at 200 milliseconds and capped at 7 seconds.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="reliability">
      Reliability
    </h4>
    <p>
      In Kubernetes 1.4, we updated the logic of the node controller to better handle
      cases when a large number of nodes have problems with reaching the master
      (e.g. because the master has networking problems). Starting with 1.4, the node
      controller looks at the state of all nodes in the cluster when making a
      decision about pod eviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, node controller limits the eviction rate to
      <code>
        --node-eviction-rate
      </code>
      (default 0.1) per second, meaning it won&rsquo;t evict pods
      from more than 1 node per 10 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The node eviction behavior changes when a node in a given availability zone
      becomes unhealthy. The node controller checks what percentage of nodes in the zone
      are unhealthy (NodeReady condition is ConditionUnknown or ConditionFalse) at
      the same time. If the fraction of unhealthy nodes is at least
      <code>
        --unhealthy-zone-threshold
      </code>
      (default 0.55) then the eviction rate is reduced:
      if the cluster is small (i.e. has less than or equal to
      <code>
        --large-cluster-size-threshold
      </code>
      nodes - default 50) then evictions are
      stopped, otherwise the eviction rate is reduced to
      <code>
        --secondary-node-eviction-rate
      </code>
      (default 0.01) per second. The reason these
      policies are implemented per availability zone is because one availability zone
      might become partitioned from the master while the others remain connected. If
      your cluster does not span multiple cloud provider availability zones, then
      there is only one availability zone (the whole cluster).
    </p>
    <p>
      A key reason for spreading your nodes across availability zones is so that the
      workload can be shifted to healthy zones when one entire zone goes down.
      Therefore, if all nodes in a zone are unhealthy then the node controller evicts at
      the normal rate of
      <code>
        --node-eviction-rate
      </code>
      .  The corner case is when all zones are
      completely unhealthy (i.e. there are no healthy nodes in the cluster). In such a
      case, the node controller assumes that there&rsquo;s some problem with master
      connectivity and stops all evictions until some connectivity is restored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in Kubernetes 1.6, the NodeController is also responsible for evicting
      pods that are running on nodes with
      <code>
        NoExecute
      </code>
      taints, when the pods do not tolerate
      the taints. Additionally, as an alpha feature that is disabled by default, the
      NodeController is responsible for adding taints corresponding to node problems like
      node unreachable or not ready. See
      <a href="/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/">
        this documentation
      </a>
      for details about
      <code>
        NoExecute
      </code>
      taints and the alpha feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting in version 1.8, the node controller can be made responsible for creating taints that represent
      Node conditions. This is an alpha feature of version 1.8.

    <p>
      When the kubelet flag
      <code>
        --register-node
      </code>
      is true (the default), the kubelet will attempt to
      register itself with the API server.  This is the preferred pattern, used by most distros.
    </p>
    <p>
      For self-registration, the kubelet is started with the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>
          --kubeconfig
        </code>

      </li>
      <li>
        <code>

        </code>
        - How to talk to a cloud provider to read metadata about itself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>
          --register-node
        </code>
        - Automatically register with the API server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>
          --register-with-taints
        </code>
        - Register the node with the given list of taints (comma separated
        <code>
          &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;:&lt;effect&gt;
        </code>
        ). No-op if
        <code>
          register-node
        </code>
        is false.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>

        - IP address of the node.
      </li>
      <li>

    <h4 id="manual-node-administration">
      Manual Node Administration
    </h4>
    <p>
      A cluster administrator can create and modify node objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the administrator wishes to create node objects manually, set the kubelet flag
      <code>
        --register-node=false
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The administrator can modify node resources (regardless of the setting of
      <code>
        --register-node
      </code>
      ).
      Modifications include setting labels on the node and marking it unschedulable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Labels on nodes can be used in conjunction with node selectors on pods to control scheduling,
      e.g. to constrain a pod to only be eligible to run on a subset of the nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marking a node as unschedulable prevents new pods from being scheduled to that
      node, but does not affect any existing pods on the node. This is useful as a
      preparatory step before a node reboot, etc. For example, to mark a node
      unschedulable, run this command:
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">kubectl cordon <span style="color:#b8860b">$NODENAME</span></code></pre>
    </div>
    <blockquote class="note">
      <div>
        <strong>
          Note:
        </strong>
        Pods created by a DaemonSet controller bypass the Kubernetes scheduler
        and do not respect the unschedulable attribute on a node. This assumes that daemons belong on
        the machine even if it is being drained of applications while it prepares for a reboot.
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote class="caution">

        <code>
          kubectl cordon
        </code>
        marks a node as &lsquo;unschedulable&rsquo;, which has the side effect of the service
        controller removing the node from any LoadBalancer node target lists it was previously
        eligible for, effectively removing incoming load balancer traffic from the cordoned node(s).

    <h3 id="node-capacity">
      Node capacity
    </h3>
    <p>
      The capacity of the node (number of cpus and amount of memory) is part of the node object.
      Normally, nodes register themselves and report their capacity when creating the node object. If
      you are doing
      <a href="#manual-node-administration">
        manual node administration
      </a>
      , then you need to set node
      capacity when adding a node.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kubernetes scheduler ensures that there are enough resources for all the pods on a node.  It
      checks that the sum of the requests of containers on the node is no greater than the node capacity.  It
      includes all containers started by the kubelet, but not containers started directly by the
      <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/components/#container-runtime">
        container runtime
      </a>
      nor any process running outside of the containers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to explicitly reserve resources for non-Pod processes, follow this tutorial to
