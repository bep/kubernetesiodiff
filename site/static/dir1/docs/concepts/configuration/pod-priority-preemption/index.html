          to the Pod template of a
          collection object like a Deployment.

      If you try the feature and then decide to disable it, you must remove the
      PodPriority command-line flag or set it to
      <code>
        false
      </code>
      , and then restart the API
      server and scheduler. After the feature is disabled, the existing Pods keep
      their priority fields, but preemption is disabled, and priority fields are
      ignored. If the feature is disabled, you cannot set
      <code>
        priorityClassName

      PriorityClass
    </h2>
    <p>
      A PriorityClass is a non-namespaced object that defines a mapping from a
      priority class name to the integer value of the priority. The name is specified
      in the
      <code>
        name
      </code>
      field of the PriorityClass object&rsquo;s metadata. The value is
      specified in the required
      <code>
        value
      </code>
      field. The higher the value, the higher the
      priority.
      The name of a PriorityClass object must be a valid
      <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names">
        DNS subdomain name
      </a>
      ,
      and it cannot be prefixed with
      <code>
        system-
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      A PriorityClass object can have any 32-bit integer value smaller than or equal
      to 1 billion. Larger numbers are reserved for critical system Pods that should
      not normally be preempted or evicted. A cluster admin should create one
      PriorityClass object for each such mapping that they want.
    </p>
    <p>
      PriorityClass also has two optional fields:
      <code>
        globalDefault
      </code>
      and
      <code>
        description
      </code>
      .
      The
      <code>
        globalDefault
      </code>
      field indicates that the value of this PriorityClass should
      be used for Pods without a
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      . Only one PriorityClass with
      <code>
        globalDefault
      </code>
      set to true can exist in the system. If there is no
      PriorityClass with
      <code>
        globalDefault
      </code>
      set, the priority of Pods with no
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      is zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <code>
        description
      </code>
      field is an arbitrary string. It is meant to tell users of the
      cluster when they should use this PriorityClass.

      Pods with

        PreemptionPolicy: Never
      </code>
      will be placed in the scheduling queue
      ahead of lower-priority pods,

      A non-preempting pod waiting to be scheduled will stay in the scheduling queue,
      until sufficient resources are free,
      and it can be scheduled.
      Non-preempting pods,
      like other pods,
      are subject to scheduler back-off.
      This means that if the scheduler tries these pods and they cannot be scheduled,
      they will be retried with lower frequency,
      allowing other pods with lower priority to be scheduled before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-preempting pods may still be preempted by other,
      high-priority pods.

      <code>

      which will allow pods of that PriorityClass to preempt lower-priority pods
      (as is existing default behavior).
      If

        PreemptionPolicy
      </code>
      is set to
      <code>
        Never
      </code>
      ,
      pods in that PriorityClass will be non-preempting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use of the
      <code>

      An example use case is for data science workloads.
      A user may submit a job that they want to be prioritized above other workloads,
      but do not wish to discard existing work by preempting running pods.
      The high priority job with
      <code>
        PreemptionPolicy: Never

      will be scheduled
      ahead of other queued pods,
      as soon as sufficient cluster resources &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; become free.

      After you have one or more PriorityClasses, you can create Pods that specify one
      of those PriorityClass names in their specifications. The priority admission
      controller uses the
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      field and populates the integer value of
      the priority. If the priority class is not found, the Pod is rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following YAML is an example of a Pod configuration that uses the
      PriorityClass created in the preceding example. The priority admission
      controller checks the specification and resolves the priority of the Pod to
      1000000.

      Effect of Pod priority on scheduling order
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Pod priority is enabled, the scheduler orders pending Pods by
      their priority and a pending Pod is placed ahead of other pending Pods
      with lower priority in the scheduling queue. As a result, the higher
      priority Pod may be scheduled sooner than Pods with lower priority if
      its scheduling requirements are met. If such Pod cannot be scheduled,
      scheduler will continue and tries to schedule other lower priority Pods.
    </p>
    <h2 id="preemption">
      Preemption
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Pods are created, they go to a queue and wait to be scheduled. The
      scheduler picks a Pod from the queue and tries to schedule it on a Node. If no
      Node is found that satisfies all the specified requirements of the Pod,
      preemption logic is triggered for the pending Pod. Let&rsquo;s call the pending Pod P.
      Preemption logic tries to find a Node where removal of one or more Pods with
      lower priority than P would enable P to be scheduled on that Node. If such a
      Node is found, one or more lower priority Pods get evicted from the Node. After
      the Pods are gone, P can be scheduled on the Node.
    </p>
    <h3 id="user-exposed-information">
      User exposed information
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Pod P preempts one or more Pods on Node N,
      <code>
        nominatedNodeName
      </code>
      field of Pod
      P&rsquo;s status is set to the name of Node N. This field helps scheduler track
      resources reserved for Pod P and also gives users information about preemptions
      in their clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that Pod P is not necessarily scheduled to the &ldquo;nominated Node&rdquo;.
      After victim Pods are preempted, they get their graceful termination period. If
      another node becomes available while scheduler is waiting for the victim Pods to
      terminate, scheduler will use the other node to schedule Pod P. As a result
      <code>
        nominatedNodeName
      </code>
      and
      <code>
        nodeName
      </code>
      of Pod spec are not always the same. Also, if
      scheduler preempts Pods on Node N, but then a higher priority Pod than Pod P
      arrives, scheduler may give Node N to the new higher priority Pod. In such a
      case, scheduler clears
      <code>
        nominatedNodeName
      </code>
      of Pod P. By doing this, scheduler
      makes Pod P eligible to preempt Pods on another Node.

      They have that much time to finish their work and exit. If they don&rsquo;t, they are
      killed. This graceful termination period creates a time gap between the point
      that the scheduler preempts Pods and the time when the pending Pod (P) can be
      scheduled on the Node (N). In the meantime, the scheduler keeps scheduling other
      pending Pods. As victims exit or get terminated, the scheduler tries to schedule
      Pods in the pending queue. Therefore, there is usually a time gap between the
      point that scheduler preempts victims and the time that Pod P is scheduled. In
      order to minimize this gap, one can set graceful termination period of lower
      priority Pods to zero or a small number.

          Note:

        Preemption does not necessarily remove all lower-priority

        lower-priority Pods, then only a portion of the lower-priority Pods are removed.
        Even so, the answer to the preceding question must be yes. If the answer is no,
        the Node is not considered for preemption.

    <p>
      If a pending Pod has inter-pod affinity to one or more of the lower-priority
      Pods on the Node, the inter-Pod affinity rule cannot be satisfied in the absence
      of those lower-priority Pods. In this case, the scheduler does not preempt any
      Pods on the Node. Instead, it looks for another Node. The scheduler might find a
      suitable Node or it might not. There is no guarantee that the pending Pod can be
      scheduled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our recommended solution for this problem is to create inter-Pod affinity only
      towards equal or higher priority Pods.

    <h4 id="cross-node-preemption">
      Cross node preemption
    </h4>
    <p>
      Suppose a Node N is being considered for preemption so that a pending Pod P can
      be scheduled on N. P might become feasible on N only if a Pod on another Node is
      preempted. Here&rsquo;s an example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pod P is being considered for Node N.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pod Q is running on another Node in the same Zone as Node N.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pod P has Zone-wide anti-affinity with Pod Q (
        <code>
          topologyKey:
          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone
        </code>
        ).
      </li>
      <li>
        There are no other cases of anti-affinity between Pod P and other Pods in
        the Zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        In order to schedule Pod P on Node N, Pod Q can be preempted, but scheduler
        does not perform cross-node preemption. So, Pod P will be deemed
        unschedulable on Node N.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If Pod Q were removed from its Node, the Pod anti-affinity violation would be
      gone, and Pod P could possibly be scheduled on Node N.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may consider adding cross Node preemption in future versions if there is
      enough demand and if we find an algorithm with reasonable performance.

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">
      Troubleshooting
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pod priority and pre-emption can have unwanted side effects. Here are some
      examples of potential problems and ways to deal with them.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pods-are-preempted-unnecessarily">
      Pods are preempted unnecessarily
    </h3>
    <p>
      Preemption removes existing Pods from a cluster under resource pressure to make
      room for higher priority pending Pods. If you give high priorities to
      certain Pods by mistake, these unintentionally high priority Pods may cause
      preemption in your cluster. Pod priority is specified by setting the
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      field in the Pod&rsquo;s specification. The integer value for
      priority is then resolved and populated to the
      <code>
        priority
      </code>
      field of
      <code>
        podSpec
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      To address the problem, you can change the
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      for those Pods
      to use lower priority classes, or leave that field empty. An empty
      <code>
        priorityClassName
      </code>
      is resolved to zero by default.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a Pod is preempted, there will be events recorded for the preempted Pod.
      Preemption should happen only when a cluster does not have enough resources for
      a Pod. In such cases, preemption happens only when the priority of the pending
      Pod (preemptor) is higher than the victim Pods. Preemption must not happen when
      there is no pending Pod, or when the pending Pods have equal or lower priority
      than the victims. If preemption happens in such scenarios, please file an issue.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pods-are-preempted-but-the-preemptor-is-not-scheduled">
      Pods are preempted, but the preemptor is not scheduled
    </h3>
    <p>
      When pods are preempted, they receive their requested graceful termination
      period, which is by default 30 seconds. If the victim Pods do not terminate within
      this period, they are forcibly terminated. Once all the victims go away, the
      preemptor Pod can be scheduled.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the preemptor Pod is waiting for the victims to go away, a higher priority
      Pod may be created that fits on the same Node. In this case, the scheduler will
      schedule the higher priority Pod instead of the preemptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is expected behavior: the Pod with the higher priority should take the place
      of a Pod with a lower priority. Other controller actions, such as
      <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-management/#cluster-autoscaling">
        cluster autoscaling
      </a>
      ,
      may eventually provide capacity to schedule the pending Pods.
    </p>
    <h3 id="higher-priority-pods-are-preempted-before-lower-priority-pods">
      Higher priority Pods are preempted before lower priority pods
    </h3>
    <p>
      The scheduler tries to find nodes that can run a pending Pod. If no node is
      found, the scheduler tries to remove Pods with lower priority from an arbitrary
      node in order to make room for the pending pod.
      If a node with low priority Pods is not feasible to run the pending Pod, the scheduler
      may choose another node with higher priority Pods (compared to the Pods on the
      other node) for preemption. The victims must still have lower priority than the
      preemptor Pod.
    </p>
    <p>
      When there are multiple nodes available for preemption, the scheduler tries to
      choose the node with a set of Pods with lowest priority. However, if such Pods
      have PodDisruptionBudget that would be violated if they are preempted then the
      scheduler may choose another node with higher priority Pods.
    </p>
    <p>
      When multiple nodes exist for preemption and none of the above scenarios apply,
      the scheduler chooses a node with the lowest priority.

        QoS class
        <span class='tooltip-text'>
          QoS Class (Quality of Service Class) provides a way for Kubernetes to classify pods within the cluster into several classes and make decisions about scheduling and eviction.
        </span>
      </a>
      are two orthogonal features with few interactions and no default restrictions on
      setting the priority of a Pod based on its QoS classes. The scheduler&rsquo;s
      preemption logic does not consider QoS when choosing preemption targets.
      Preemption considers Pod priority and attempts to choose a set of targets with
      the lowest priority. Higher-priority Pods are considered for preemption only if
      the removal of the lowest priority Pods is not sufficient to allow the scheduler
      to schedule the preemptor Pod, or if the lowest priority Pods are protected by
      <code>
        PodDisruptionBudget
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The only component that considers both QoS and Pod priority is
      <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/">
        kubelet out-of-resource eviction
      </a>
      .
      The kubelet ranks Pods for eviction first by whether or not their usage of the
      starved resource exceeds requests, then by Priority, and then by the consumption
      of the starved compute resource relative to the Pods’ scheduling requests.
      See
      <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/out-of-resource/#evicting-end-user-pods">
        evicting end-user pods
      </a>
      for more details.
    </p>
    <p>
      kubelet out-of-resource eviction does not evict Pods when their
      usage does not exceed their requests. If a Pod with lower priority is not
      exceeding its requests, it won&rsquo;t be evicted. Another Pod with higher priority
      that exceeds its requests may be evicted.
