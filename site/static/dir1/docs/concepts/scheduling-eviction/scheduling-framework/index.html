      The scheduling framework is a pluggable architecture for Kubernetes Scheduler
      that makes scheduler customizations easy. It adds a new set of “plugin” APIs to
      the existing scheduler. Plugins are compiled into the scheduler. The APIs
      allow most scheduling features to be implemented as plugins, while keeping the
      scheduling “core” simple and maintainable. Refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-scheduling/20180409-scheduling-framework.md">

        scheduling framework

      The Scheduling Framework defines a few extension points. Scheduler plugins
      register to be invoked at one or more extension points. Some of these plugins
      can change the scheduling decisions and some are informational only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each attempt to schedule one Pod is split into two phases, the
      <strong>
        scheduling
        cycle
      </strong>
      and the
      <strong>
        binding cycle
      </strong>
      .
    </p>
    <h2 id="scheduling-cycle-binding-cycle">
      Scheduling Cycle &amp; Binding Cycle
    </h2>
    <p>
      The scheduling cycle selects a node for the Pod, and the binding cycle applies
      that decision to the cluster. Together, a scheduling cycle and binding cycle are
      referred to as a “scheduling context”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scheduling cycles are run serially, while binding cycles may run concurrently.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scheduling or binding cycle can be aborted if the Pod is determined to
      be unschedulable or if there is an internal error. The Pod will be returned to
      the queue and retried.
    </p>
    <h2 id="extension-points">
      Extension points
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following picture shows the scheduling context of a Pod and the extension
      points that the scheduling framework exposes. In this picture “Filter” is
      equivalent to “Predicate” and “Scoring” is equivalent to “Priority function”.
    </p>
    <p>
      One plugin may register at multiple extension points to perform more complex or
      stateful tasks.

    <h3 id="queue-sort">
      QueueSort
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to sort Pods in the scheduling queue. A queue sort plugin
      essentially provides a
      <code>
        Less(Pod1, Pod2)
      </code>
      function. Only one queue sort
      plugin may be enabled at a time.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pre-filter">
      PreFilter
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to pre-process info about the Pod, or to check certain
      conditions that the cluster or the Pod must meet. If a PreFilter plugin returns
      an error, the scheduling cycle is aborted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="filter">
      Filter
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to filter out nodes that cannot run the Pod. For each
      node, the scheduler will call filter plugins in their configured order. If any
      filter plugin marks the node as infeasible, the remaining plugins will not be
      called for that node. Nodes may be evaluated concurrently.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pre-score">
      PreScore
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to perform “pre-scoring” work, which generates a sharable
      state for Score plugins to use. If a PreScore plugin returns an error, the
      scheduling cycle is aborted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="scoring">
      Score
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to rank nodes that have passed the filtering phase. The
      scheduler will call each scoring plugin for each node. There will be a well
      defined range of integers representing the minimum and maximum scores. After the
      <a href="#normalize-scoring">
        NormalizeScore
      </a>
      phase, the scheduler will combine node
      scores from all plugins according to the configured plugin weights.
    </p>
    <h3 id="normalize-scoring">
      NormalizeScore
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to modify scores before the scheduler computes a final
      ranking of Nodes. A plugin that registers for this extension point will be
      called with the
      <a href="#scoring">
        Score
      </a>
      results from the same plugin. This is called
      once per plugin per scheduling cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, suppose a plugin
      <code>
        BlinkingLightScorer
      </code>
      ranks Nodes based on how
      many blinking lights they have.
    </p>
    <div class="highlight">
      <pre style="background-color:#f8f8f8;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">func</span> <span style="color:#00a000">ScoreNode</span>(_ <span style="color:#666">*</span>v1.pod, n <span style="color:#666">*</span>v1.Node) (<span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:bold">int</span>, <span style="color:#0b0;font-weight:bold">error</span>) {
    <span style="color:#a2f;font-weight:bold">return</span> <span style="color:#00a000">getBlinkingLightCount</span>(n)
}</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      However, the maximum count of blinking lights may be small compared to
      <code>
        NodeScoreMax
      </code>
      . To fix this,
      <code>
        BlinkingLightScorer
      </code>
      should also register for this
      extension point.
    </p>

    <h3 id="reserve">
      Reserve
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is an informational extension point. Plugins which maintain runtime state
      (aka “stateful plugins”) should use this extension point to be notified by the
      scheduler when resources on a node are being reserved for a given Pod. This
      happens before the scheduler actually binds the Pod to the Node, and it exists
      to prevent race conditions while the scheduler waits for the bind to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the last step in a scheduling cycle. Once a Pod is in the reserved
      state, it will either trigger
      <a href="#unreserve">
        Unreserve
      </a>
      plugins (on failure) or
      <a href="#post-bind">
        PostBind
      </a>
      plugins (on success) at the end of the binding cycle.
    </p>
    <h3 id="permit">
      Permit
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>
        Permit
      </em>
      plugins are invoked at the end of the scheduling cycle for each Pod, to
      prevent or delay the binding to the candidate node. A permit plugin can do one of
      the three things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            approve
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Once all Permit plugins approve a Pod, it is sent for binding.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            deny
          </strong>
          <br/>
          If any Permit plugin denies a Pod, it is returned to the scheduling queue.
          This will trigger
          <a href="#unreserve">
            Unreserve
          </a>
          plugins.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            wait
          </strong>
          (with a timeout)
          <br/>
          If a Permit plugin returns “wait”, then the Pod is kept in an internal “waiting”
          Pods list, and the binding cycle of this Pod starts but directly blocks until it
          gets
          <a href="#frameworkhandle">
            approved
          </a>
          . If a timeout occurs,
          <strong>
            wait
          </strong>
          becomes
          <strong>
            deny
          </strong>
          and the Pod is returned to the scheduling queue, triggering
          <a href="#unreserve">
            Unreserve
          </a>
          plugins.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote class="note">
      <div>
        <strong>
          Note:
        </strong>
        While any plugin can access the list of “waiting” Pods and approve them
        (see
        <a href="#frameworkhandle">
          <code>
            FrameworkHandle
          </code>
        </a>
        ), we expect only the permit
        plugins to approve binding of reserved Pods that are in “waiting” state. Once a Pod
        is approved, it is sent to the
        <a href="#pre-bind">
          PreBind
        </a>
        phase.
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="pre-bind">
      PreBind
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to perform any work required before a Pod is bound. For
      example, a pre-bind plugin may provision a network volume and mount it on the
      target node before allowing the Pod to run there.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any PreBind plugin returns an error, the Pod is
      <a href="#unreserve">

      returned to the scheduling queue.
    </p>
    <h3 id="bind">
      Bind
    </h3>
    <p>
      These plugins are used to bind a Pod to a Node. Bind plugins will not be called
      until all PreBind plugins have completed. Each bind plugin is called in the
      configured order. A bind plugin may choose whether or not to handle the given
      Pod. If a bind plugin chooses to handle a Pod,
      <strong>
        the remaining bind plugins are
        skipped
      </strong>
      .
    </p>
    <h3 id="post-bind">
      PostBind
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is an informational extension point. Post-bind plugins are called after a
      Pod is successfully bound. This is the end of a binding cycle, and can be used
      to clean up associated resources.
    </p>
    <h3 id="unreserve">
      Unreserve
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is an informational extension point. If a Pod was reserved and then
      rejected in a later phase, then unreserve plugins will be notified. Unreserve
      plugins should clean up state associated with the reserved Pod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plugins that use this extension point usually should also use

      There are two steps to the plugin API. First, plugins must register and get
