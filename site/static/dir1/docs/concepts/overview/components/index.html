      When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.

          A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called

          that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

      runs across multiple computers and a cluster usually runs multiple nodes, providing
      fault-tolerance and high availability.

      Control Plane Components

      The Control Plane’s components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new

        replicas

      field is unsatisfied).
    </p>
    <p>
      Control Plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster. However,
      for simplicity, set up scripts typically start all Control Plane components on
      the same machine, and do not run user containers on this machine. See
      <a href="/docs/admin/high-availability/">

      The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

        cloud-controller-manager

      runs controllers that interact with the underlying cloud providers. The cloud-controller-manager binary is an alpha feature introduced in Kubernetes release 1.6.
    </p>
    <p>
      cloud-controller-manager runs cloud-provider-specific controller loops only. You must disable these controller loops in the kube-controller-manager. You can disable the controller loops by setting the
      <code>
        --cloud-provider
      </code>
      flag to
      <code>
        external
      </code>
      when starting the kube-controller-manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      cloud-controller-manager allows the cloud vendor’s code and the Kubernetes code to evolve independently of each other. In prior releases, the core Kubernetes code was dependent upon cloud-provider-specific code for functionality. In future releases, code specific to cloud vendors should be maintained by the cloud vendor themselves, and linked to cloud-controller-manager while running Kubernetes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following controllers have cloud provider dependencies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Node Controller: For checking the cloud provider to determine if a node has been deleted in the cloud after it stops responding
      </li>
      <li>
        Route Controller: For setting up routes in the underlying cloud infrastructure
      </li>
      <li>
        Service Controller: For creating, updating and deleting cloud provider load balancers
      </li>
      <li>
        Volume Controller: For creating, attaching, and mounting volumes, and interacting with the cloud provider to orchestrate volumes
