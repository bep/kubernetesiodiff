        You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must
        be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you do not already have a
        cluster, you can create one by using
        <a href="/docs/setup/learning-environment/minikube/">
          Minikube
        </a>
        ,
        or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

      EndpointSlices provide a scalable and extensible alternative to Endpoints in
      Kubernetes. They build on top of the base of functionality provided by Endpoints
      and extend that in a scalable way. When Services have a large number (&gt;100) of
      network endpoints, they will be split into multiple smaller EndpointSlice
      resources instead of a single large Endpoints resource.

          This feature is currently in a
          <em>
            beta

          state, meaning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The version names contain beta (e.g. v2beta3).
          </li>
          <li>
            Code is well tested. Enabling the feature is considered safe. Enabled by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support for the overall feature will not be dropped, though details may change.
          </li>
          <li>
            The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. When this happens, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. This may require deleting, editing, and re-creating API objects. The editing process may require some thought. This may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommended for only non-business-critical uses because of potential for incompatible changes in subsequent releases. If you have multiple clusters that can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction.

        Although EndpointSlices may eventually replace Endpoints, many Kubernetes
        components still rely on Endpoints. For now, enabling EndpointSlices should be
        seen as an addition to Endpoints in a cluster, not a replacement for them.

      EndpointSlices are a beta feature. Both the API and the EndpointSlice

      are enabled by default.
      <a class='glossary-tooltip' href='/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-proxy/' target='_blank'>

      uses Endpoints by default, not EndpointSlices.
    </p>
    <p>
      For better scalability and performance, you can enable the

      <a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/">

      </a>

      switches the data source to be EndpointSlices, which reduces the amount of
      Kubernetes API traffic to and from kube-proxy.

      Using EndpointSlices
    </h2>
    <p>
      With EndpointSlices fully enabled in your cluster, you should see corresponding
      EndpointSlice resources for each Endpoints resource. In addition to supporting
      existing Endpoints functionality, EndpointSlices include new bits of information
      such as topology. They will allow for greater scalability and extensibility of
      network endpoints in your cluster.
