      Web UI (Dashboard)
    </h1>
    <p>
      Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources. You can use Dashboard to get an overview of applications running on your cluster, as well as for creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc). For example, you can scale a Deployment, initiate a rolling update, restart a pod or deploy new applications using a deploy wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dashboard also provides information on the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.

      Dashboard lets you create and deploy a containerized application as a Deployment and optional Service with a simple wizard. You can either manually specify application details, or upload a YAML or JSON file containing application configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the

    <p>
      The deploy wizard expects that you provide the following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          App name
        </strong>
        (mandatory): Name for your application. A
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/">
          label
        </a>
        with the name will be added to the Deployment and Service, if any, that will be deployed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The application name must be unique within the selected Kubernetes
      <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/namespaces/">
        namespace
      </a>
      . It must start with a lowercase character, and end with a lowercase character or a number, and contain only lowercase letters, numbers and dashes (-). It is limited to 24 characters. Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
    </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Container image
          </strong>
          (mandatory): The URL of a public Docker
          <a href="/docs/concepts/containers/images/">
            container image
          </a>
          on any registry, or a private image (commonly hosted on the Google Container Registry or Docker Hub). The container image specification must end with a colon.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Number of pods
          </strong>
          (mandatory): The target number of Pods you want your application to be deployed in. The value must be a positive integer.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A
      <a href="/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">
        Deployment
      </a>
      will be created to maintain the desired number of Pods across your cluster.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Service
        </strong>
        (optional): For some parts of your application (e.g. frontends) you may want to expose a
        <a href="/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">
          Service
        </a>
        onto an external, maybe public IP address outside of your cluster (external Service). For external Services, you may need to open up one or more ports to do so. Find more details
        <a href="/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-cloud-provider-firewall/">
          here
        </a>
        .
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other Services that are only visible from inside the cluster are called internal Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irrespective of the Service type, if you choose to create a Service and your container listens on a port (incoming), you need to specify two ports. The Service will be created mapping the port (incoming) to the target port seen by the container. This Service will route to your deployed Pods. Supported protocols are TCP and UDP. The internal DNS name for this Service will be the value you specified as application name above.
    </p>
    <p>
      If needed, you can expand the
      <strong>
        Advanced options
      </strong>
      section where you can specify more settings:

        . They let you partition resources into logically named groups.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Dashboard offers all available namespaces in a dropdown list, and allows you to create a new namespace. The namespace name may contain a maximum of 63 alphanumeric characters and dashes (-) but can not contain capital letters.
      Namespace names should not consist of only numbers. If the name is set as a number, such as 10, the pod will be put in the default namespace.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Dashboard offers all available secrets in a dropdown list, and allows you to create a new secret. The secret name must follow the DNS domain name syntax, for example
      <code>
        new.image-pull.secret

      Using Dashboard
    </h2>
    <p>
      Following sections describe views of the Kubernetes Dashboard UI; what they provide and how can they be used.
    </p>
    <h3 id="navigation">
      Navigation
    </h3>
    <p>
      When there are Kubernetes objects defined in the cluster, Dashboard shows them in the initial view. By default only objects from the
      <em>
        default
      </em>
      namespace are shown and this can be changed using the namespace selector located in the navigation menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dashboard shows most Kubernetes object kinds and groups them in a few menu categories.
    </p>
    <h4 id="admin-overview">
      Admin Overview
    </h4>
    <p>
      For cluster and namespace administrators, Dashboard lists Nodes, Namespaces and Persistent Volumes and has detail views for them. Node list view contains CPU and memory usage metrics aggregated across all Nodes. The details view shows the metrics for a Node, its specification, status, allocated resources, events and pods running on the node.
    </p>
    <h4 id="workloads">
      Workloads
    </h4>
    <p>
      Shows all applications running in the selected namespace. The view lists applications by workload kind (e.g., Deployments, Replica Sets, Stateful Sets, etc.) and each workload kind can be viewed separately. The lists summarize actionable information about the workloads, such as the number of ready pods for a Replica Set or current memory usage for a Pod.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detail views for workloads show status and specification information and surface relationships between objects. For example, Pods that Replica Set is controlling or New Replica Sets and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers for Deployments.
    </p>
    <h4 id="services">
      Services
    </h4>
    <p>
      Shows Kubernetes resources that allow for exposing services to external world and discovering them within a cluster. For that reason, Service and Ingress views show Pods targeted by them, internal endpoints for cluster connections and external endpoints for external users.
    </p>
    <h4 id="storage">
      Storage
    </h4>
    <p>
      Storage view shows Persistent Volume Claim resources which are used by applications for storing data.
    </p>
    <h4 id="config-maps-and-secrets">
      Config Maps and Secrets
    </h4>
    <p>
      Shows all Kubernetes resources that are used for live configuration of applications running in clusters. The view allows for editing and managing config objects and displays secrets hidden by default.
    </p>
    <h4 id="logs-viewer">
      Logs viewer
    </h4>
    <p>
      Pod lists and detail pages link to a logs viewer that is built into Dashboard. The viewer allows for drilling down logs from containers belonging to a single Pod.
