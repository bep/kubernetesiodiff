    </p>
    <p>
      We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
      everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
      sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
      religion, or nationality.
