      IBM® Cloud Private is a turnkey cloud solution and an on-premises turnkey cloud solution. IBM Cloud Private delivers pure upstream Kubernetes with the typical management components that are required to run real enterprise workloads. These workloads include health management, log management, audit trails, and metering for tracking usage of workloads on the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      IBM Cloud Private is available in a community edition and a fully supported enterprise edition. The community edition is available at no charge from
      <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/ibmcom/icp-inception/">
        Docker Hub
      </a>
      . The enterprise edition supports high availability topologies and includes commercial support from IBM for Kubernetes and the IBM Cloud Private management platform. If you want to try IBM Cloud Private, you can use either the hosted trial, the tutorial, or the self-guided demo. You can also try the free community edition. For details, see

      IBM Cloud Private has a Quick Start that automatically deploys IBM Cloud Private into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on the AWS Cloud. A regular deployment takes about 60 minutes, and a high availability (HA) deployment takes about 75 minutes to complete. The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates and a deployment guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Quick Start is for users who want to explore application modernization and want to accelerate meeting their digital transformation goals, by using IBM Cloud Private and IBM tooling. The Quick Start helps users rapidly deploy a high availability (HA), production-grade, IBM Cloud Private reference architecture on AWS. For all of the details and the deployment guide, see the
