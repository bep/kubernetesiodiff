    <h1>
      Extending your Kubernetes Cluster
    </h1>
    <p>
      Kubernetes is highly configurable and extensible. As a result,
      there is rarely a need to fork or submit patches to the Kubernetes
      project code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide describes the options for customizing a Kubernetes
      cluster. It is aimed at

    <p>
      Customization approaches can be broadly divided into
      <em>
        configuration
      </em>
      , which only involves changing flags, local configuration files, or API resources; and
      <em>
        extensions
      </em>
      , which involve running additional programs or services. This document is primarily about extensions.

        Configuration files
      </em>
      and
      <em>
        flags
      </em>
      are documented in the Reference section of the online documentation, under each binary:

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Flags and configuration files may not always be changeable in a hosted Kubernetes service or a distribution with managed installation. When they are changeable, they are usually only changeable by the cluster administrator. Also, they are subject to change in future Kubernetes versions, and setting them may require restarting processes. For those reasons, they should be used only when there are no other options.

      <em>
        Built-in Policy APIs

      <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">
        RBAC
      </a>
      ), are built-in Kubernetes APIs. APIs are typically used with hosted Kubernetes services and with managed Kubernetes installations. They are declarative and use the same conventions as other Kubernetes resources like pods, so new cluster configuration can be repeatable and be managed the same way as applications. And, where they are stable, they enjoy a
      <a href="/docs/reference/deprecation-policy/">
        defined support policy
      </a>
      like other Kubernetes APIs. For these reasons, they are preferred over
      <em>
        configuration files

      and
      <em>
        flags
      </em>

    <h2 id="extensions">
      Extensions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Extensions are software components that extend and deeply integrate with Kubernetes.
      They adapt it to support new types and new kinds of hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most cluster administrators will use a hosted or distribution
      instance of Kubernetes. As a result, most Kubernetes users will need to
      install extensions and fewer will need to author new ones.
    </p>
    <h2 id="extension-patterns">
      Extension Patterns
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kubernetes is designed to be automated by writing client programs. Any
      program that reads and/or writes to the Kubernetes API can provide useful
      automation.
      <em>
        Automation
      </em>
      can run on the cluster or off it. By following
      the guidance in this doc you can write highly available and robust automation.
      Automation generally works with any Kubernetes cluster, including hosted
      clusters and managed installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a specific pattern for writing client programs that work well with
      Kubernetes called the
      <em>
        Controller
      </em>
      pattern. Controllers typically read an
      object&rsquo;s
      <code>
        .spec
      </code>
      , possibly do things, and then update the object&rsquo;s
      <code>
        .status
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      A controller is a client of Kubernetes. When Kubernetes is the client and
      calls out to a remote service, it is called a
      <em>
        Webhook
      </em>
      . The remote service
      is called a
      <em>
        Webhook Backend
      </em>
      . Like Controllers, Webhooks do add a point of
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the webhook model, Kubernetes makes a network request to a remote service.
      In the
      <em>
        Binary Plugin
      </em>
      model, Kubernetes executes a binary (program).
      Binary plugins are used by the kubelet (e.g.
      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-storage/flexvolume.md">
        Flex Volume
        Plugins
      </a>
      and
      <a href="/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/network-plugins/">
        Network
        Plugins
      </a>
      )
      and by kubectl.
    </p>

      Below is a diagram showing how the extension points interact with the
      Kubernetes control plane.

        Users often interact with the Kubernetes API using
        <code>
          kubectl
        </code>
        .
        <a href="/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/">
          Kubectl plugins
        </a>
        extend the kubectl binary. They only affect the individual user&rsquo;s local environment, and so cannot enforce site-wide policies.
      </li>

        The apiserver handles all requests. Several types of extension points in the apiserver allow authenticating requests, or blocking them based on their content, editing content, and handling deletion. These are described in the
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/extending#api-access-extensions">
          API Access Extensions
        </a>
        section.
      </li>
      <li>
        The apiserver serves various kinds of
        <em>
          resources
        </em>
        .
        <em>
          Built-in resource kinds
        </em>
        , like
        <code>
          pods
        </code>
        , are defined by the Kubernetes project and can&rsquo;t be changed. You can also add resources that you define, or that other projects have defined, called
        <em>
          Custom Resources
        </em>
        , as explained in the
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/extending#user-defined-types">
          Custom Resources
        </a>
        section. Custom Resources are often used with API Access Extensions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Kubernetes scheduler decides which nodes to place pods on. There are several ways to extend scheduling. These are described in the
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/extending#scheduler-extensions">
          Scheduler Extensions
        </a>
        section.
      </li>
      <li>
        Much of the behavior of Kubernetes is implemented by programs called Controllers which are clients of the API-Server. Controllers are often used in conjunction with Custom Resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        The kubelet runs on servers, and helps pods appear like virtual servers with their own IPs on the cluster network.
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/extending#network-plugins">
          Network Plugins
        </a>
        allow for different implementations of pod networking.
      </li>
      <li>
        The kubelet also mounts and unmounts volumes for containers. New types of storage can be supported via
        <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/extending#storage-plugins">
          Storage Plugins

        .

      If you are unsure where to start, this flowchart can help. Note that some solutions may involve several types of extensions.

      Consider adding a Custom Resource to Kubernetes if you want to define new controllers, application configuration objects or other declarative APIs, and to manage them using Kubernetes tools, such as
      <code>
        kubectl
      </code>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not use a Custom Resource as data storage for application, user, or monitoring data.

      <a href="/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">
        Operator pattern

      . The Operator pattern is used to manage specific, usually stateful, applications. These custom APIs and control loops can also be used to control other resources, such as storage or policies.

      Changing Built-in Resources

    <p>
      When you extend the Kubernetes API by adding custom resources, the added resources always fall into a new API Groups. You cannot replace or change existing API groups.
      Adding an API does not directly let you affect the behavior of existing APIs (e.g. Pods), but API Access Extensions do.

      When a request reaches the Kubernetes API Server, it is first Authenticated, then Authorized, then subject to various types of Admission Control. See

        Controlling Access to the Kubernetes API
      </a>
      for more on this flow.

    <p>
      Each of these steps offers extension points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kubernetes has several built-in authentication methods that it supports. It can also sit behind an authenticating proxy, and it can send a token from an Authorization header to a remote service for verification (a webhook). All of these methods are covered in the
