      Overview of Cloud Native Security
    </h1>
    <p>
      Kubernetes Security (and security in general) is an immense topic that has many
      highly interrelated parts. In today&rsquo;s era where open source software is
      integrated into many of the systems that help web applications run,
      there are some overarching concepts that can help guide your intuition about how you can
      think about security holistically. This guide will define a mental model
      for some general concepts surrounding Cloud Native Security. The mental model is completely arbitrary
      and you should only use it if it helps you think about where to secure your software
      stack.

    <p>
      As you can see from the above figure,
      each one of the 4C&rsquo;s depend on the security of the squares in which they fit. It
      is nearly impossibly to safeguard against poor security standards in Cloud, Containers, and Code
      by only addressing security at the code level. However, when these areas are dealt
      with appropriately, then adding security to your code augments an already strong
      base. These areas of concern will now be described in more detail below.

    <h2 id="cloud">
      Cloud
    </h2>
    <p>
      In many ways, the Cloud (or co-located servers, or the corporate datacenter) is the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">
        trusted computing base
      </a>
      of a Kubernetes cluster. If these components themselves are vulnerable (or
      configured in a vulnerable way) then there&rsquo;s no real way to guarantee the security
      of any components built on top of this base. Each cloud provider has extensive
      security recommendations they make to their customers on how to run workloads securely
      in their environment. It is out of the scope of this guide to give recommendations
      on cloud security since every cloud provider and workload is different. Here are some
      links to some of the popular cloud providers&rsquo; documentation
      for security as well as give general guidance for securing the infrastructure that
      makes up a Kubernetes cluster.

      Cluster
    </h2>
    <p>
      This section will provide links for securing
      workloads in Kubernetes. There are two areas of concern for securing
      Kubernetes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Securing the components that are configurable which make up the cluster
      </li>
      <li>
        Securing the components which run in the cluster
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="components-of-the-cluster">
      Components
      <em>
        of
      </em>
      the Cluster
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you want to protect your cluster from accidental or malicious access, and adopt
      good information practices, read and follow the advice about
      <a href="/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/securing-a-cluster/">
        securing your cluster

      .

      the Cluster (your application)
    </h3>
    <p>
      Depending on the attack surface of your application, you may want to focus on specific
      aspects of security. For example, if you are running a service (Service A) that is critical
      in a chain of other resources and a separate workload (Service B) which is
      vulnerable to a resource exhaustion attack, by not putting resource limits on
      Service B you run the risk of also compromising Service A. Below is a table of
      links of things to consider when securing workloads running in Kubernetes.

            Access over TLS only
          </td>
          <td>
            If your code needs to communicate via TCP, ideally it would be performing a TLS handshake with the client ahead of time. With the exception of a few cases, the default behavior should be to encrypt everything in transit. Going one step further, even &ldquo;behind the firewall&rdquo; in our VPC&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s still a good idea to encrypt network traffic between services. This can be done through a process known as mutual or
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication">
              mTLS
            </a>
            which performs a two sided verification of communication between two certificate holding services. There are numerous tools that can be used to accomplish this in Kubernetes such as

          <td>
            Since our applications tend to have dependencies outside of our own codebases, it is a good practice to regularly scan the code&rsquo;s dependencies to ensure that they are still secure with no vulnerabilities currently filed against them. Each language has a tool for performing this check automatically.

            Most languages provide a way for a snippet of code to be analyzed for any potentially unsafe coding practices. Whenever possible you should perform checks using automated tooling that can scan codebases for common security errors. Some of the tools can be found here:

            There are a few automated tools that are able to be run against your service to try some of the well known attacks that commonly befall services. These include SQL injection, CSRF, and XSS. One of the most popular dynamic analysis tools is the OWASP Zed Attack proxy
