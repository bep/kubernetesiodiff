<h1>
  Master-Node Communication
</h1>
<p>
  This document catalogs the communication paths between the master (really the
  apiserver) and the Kubernetes cluster. The intent is to allow users to
  customize their installation to harden the network configuration such that
  the cluster can be run on an untrusted network (or on fully public IPs on a
  cloud provider).
</p>

  Cluster to Master
</h2>
<p>
  All communication paths from the cluster to the master terminate at the
  apiserver (none of the other master components are designed to expose remote
  services). In a typical deployment, the apiserver is configured to listen for
  remote connections on a secure HTTPS port (443) with one or more forms of
  client
  <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/">
    authentication
  </a>
  enabled.
  One or more forms of
  <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/">
    authorization
  </a>
  should be enabled, especially if
  <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#anonymous-requests">
    anonymous requests
  </a>
  or
  <a href="/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#service-account-tokens">
    service account tokens
  </a>
  are allowed.
</p>
<p>
  Nodes should be provisioned with the public root certificate for the cluster
  such that they can connect securely to the apiserver along with valid client
  credentials. For example, on a default GKE deployment, the client credentials
  provided to the kubelet are in the form of a client certificate. See
  <a href="/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-tls-bootstrapping/">
    kubelet TLS bootstrapping
  </a>
  for automated provisioning of kubelet client certificates.
</p>
<p>
  Pods that wish to connect to the apiserver can do so securely by leveraging a
  service account so that Kubernetes will automatically inject the public root
  certificate and a valid bearer token into the pod when it is instantiated.
  The
  <code>
    kubernetes
  </code>
  service (in all namespaces) is configured with a virtual IP
  address that is redirected (via kube-proxy) to the HTTPS endpoint on the
  apiserver.
</p>
<p>
  The master components also communicate with the cluster apiserver over the secure port.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the default operating mode for connections from the cluster
  (nodes and pods running on the nodes) to the master is secured by default
  and can run over untrusted and/or public networks.
</p>
<h2 id="master-to-cluster">
  Master to Cluster
</h2>
<p>
  There are two primary communication paths from the master (apiserver) to the
  cluster. The first is from the apiserver to the kubelet process which runs on
  each node in the cluster. The second is from the apiserver to any node, pod,
  or service through the apiserver&rsquo;s proxy functionality.
</p>
<h3 id="apiserver-to-kubelet">
  apiserver to kubelet
</h3>
<p>
  The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fetching logs for pods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attaching (through kubectl) to running pods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Providing the kubelet&rsquo;s port-forwarding functionality.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These connections terminate at the kubelet&rsquo;s HTTPS endpoint. By default,
  the apiserver does not verify the kubelet&rsquo;s serving certificate,
  which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and
  <strong>
    unsafe
  </strong>
  to run over untrusted and/or public networks.
</p>
<p>
  To verify this connection, use the
  <code>
    --kubelet-certificate-authority
  </code>
  flag to
  provide the apiserver with a root certificate bundle to use to verify the
  kubelet&rsquo;s serving certificate.
</p>
<p>
  If that is not possible, use
  <a href="/docs/concepts/architecture/master-node-communication/#ssh-tunnels">
    SSH tunneling
  </a>
  between the apiserver and kubelet if required to avoid connecting over an
  untrusted or public network.
</p>
<p>
  Finally,
  <a href="/docs/admin/kubelet-authentication-authorization/">
    Kubelet authentication and/or authorization
  </a>
  should be enabled to secure the kubelet API.
</p>
<h3 id="apiserver-to-nodes-pods-and-services">
  apiserver to nodes, pods, and services
</h3>
<p>
  The connections from the apiserver to a node, pod, or service default to plain
  HTTP connections and are therefore neither authenticated nor encrypted. They
  can be run over a secure HTTPS connection by prefixing
  <code>
    https:
  </code>
  to the node,
  pod, or service name in the API URL, but they will not validate the certificate
  provided by the HTTPS endpoint nor provide client credentials so while the
  connection will be encrypted, it will not provide any guarantees of integrity.
  These connections
  <strong>
    are not currently safe
  </strong>
  to run over untrusted and/or
  public networks.
</p>
<h3 id="ssh-tunnels">
  SSH Tunnels
</h3>
<p>
  Kubernetes supports SSH tunnels to protect the Master → Cluster communication
  paths. In this configuration, the apiserver initiates an SSH tunnel to each node
  in the cluster (connecting to the ssh server listening on port 22) and passes
  all traffic destined for a kubelet, node, pod, or service through the tunnel.
  This tunnel ensures that the traffic is not exposed outside of the network in
  which the nodes are running.
</p>
<p>
  SSH tunnels are currently deprecated so you shouldn&rsquo;t opt to use them unless you
  know what you are doing. The Konnectivity service is a replacement for this
  communication channel.

  <p>
    This feature is currently in a
    <em>
      beta
    </em>
    state, meaning:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The version names contain beta (e.g. v2beta3).
    </li>
    <li>
      Code is well tested. Enabling the feature is considered safe. Enabled by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for the overall feature will not be dropped, though details may change.
    </li>
    <li>
      The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. When this happens, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. This may require deleting, editing, and re-creating API objects. The editing process may require some thought. This may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recommended for only non-business-critical uses because of potential for incompatible changes in subsequent releases. If you have multiple clusters that can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Please do try our beta features and give feedback on them! After they exit beta, it may not be practical for us to make more changes.

  As a replacement to the SSH tunnels, the Konnectivity service provides TCP
  level proxy for the Master → Cluster communication. The Konnectivity consists of
  two parts, the Konnectivity server and the Konnectivity agents, running in the
  Master network and the Cluster network respectively. The Konnectivity agents
  initiate connections to the Konnectivity server and maintain the connections.
  All Master → Cluster traffic then goes through these connections.
