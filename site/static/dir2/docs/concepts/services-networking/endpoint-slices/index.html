  <ul>
    <li>
      The version names contain beta (e.g. v2beta3).
    </li>
    <li>
      Code is well tested. Enabling the feature is considered safe. Enabled by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for the overall feature will not be dropped, though details may change.
    </li>
    <li>
      The schema and/or semantics of objects may change in incompatible ways in a subsequent beta or stable release. When this happens, we will provide instructions for migrating to the next version. This may require deleting, editing, and re-creating API objects. The editing process may require some thought. This may require downtime for applications that rely on the feature.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recommended for only non-business-critical uses because of potential for incompatible changes in subsequent releases. If you have multiple clusters that can be upgraded independently, you may be able to relax this restriction.

        Please do try our beta features and give feedback on them! After they exit beta, it may not be practical for us to make more changes.

  Motivation
</h2>
<p>
  The Endpoints API has provided a simple and straightforward way of
  tracking network endpoints in Kubernetes. Unfortunately as Kubernetes clusters
  and Services have gotten larger, limitations of that API became more visible.
  Most notably, those included challenges with scaling to larger numbers of
  network endpoints.
</p>
<p>
  Since all network endpoints for a Service were stored in a single Endpoints
  resource, those resources could get quite large. That affected the performance
  of Kubernetes components (notably the master control plane) and resulted in
  significant amounts of network traffic and processing when Endpoints changed.
  EndpointSlices help you mitigate those issues as well as provide an extensible
  platform for additional features such as topological routing.
</p>
<h2 id="endpointslice-resource">
  EndpointSlice resources
</h2>
<p>
  In Kubernetes, an EndpointSlice contains references to a set of network
  endpoints. The EndpointSlice controller automatically creates EndpointSlices
  for a Kubernetes Service when a
  <a class='glossary-tooltip' href='/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/' target='_blank'>
    selector
    <span class='tooltip-text'>
      Allows users to filter a list of resources based on labels.
    </span>
  </a>
  is specified. These EndpointSlices will include
  references to any Pods that match the Service selector. EndpointSlices group
  network endpoints together by unique Service and Port combinations.
  The name of a EndpointSlice object must be a valid
  <a href="/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names#dns-subdomain-names">
    DNS subdomain name
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  As an example, here&rsquo;s a sample EndpointSlice resource for the
  <code>

  Kubernetes Service.

<p>
  By default, EndpointSlices managed by the EndpointSlice controller will have no
  more than 100 endpoints each. Below this scale, EndpointSlices should map 1:1
  with Endpoints and Services and have similar performance.
</p>
<p>
  EndpointSlices can act as the source of truth for kube-proxy when it comes to
  how to route internal traffic. When enabled, they should provide a performance
  improvement for services with large numbers of endpoints.
</p>
<h3 id="address-types">
  Address Types
</h3>
<p>
  EndpointSlices support three address types:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    IPv4
  </li>
  <li>
    IPv6
  </li>
  <li>
    FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="topology">
  Topology
</h3>
<p>
  Each endpoint within an EndpointSlice can contain relevant topology information.
  This is used to indicate where an endpoint is, containing information about the
  corresponding Node, zone, and region. When the values are available, the
  following Topology labels will be set by the EndpointSlice controller:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>
      kubernetes.io/hostname
    </code>
    - The name of the Node this endpoint is on.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>
      topology.kubernetes.io/zone
    </code>
    - The zone this endpoint is in.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>
      topology.kubernetes.io/region
    </code>
    - The region this endpoint is in.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The values of these labels are derived from resources associated with each
  endpoint in a slice. The hostname label represents the value of the NodeName
  field on the corresponding Pod. The zone and region labels represent the value
  of the labels with the same names on the corresponding Node.
</p>
<h3 id="management">
  Management
</h3>
<p>
  By default, EndpointSlices are created and managed by the EndpointSlice
  controller. There are a variety of other use cases for EndpointSlices, such as
  service mesh implementations, that could result in other entities or controllers
  managing additional sets of EndpointSlices. To ensure that multiple entities can
  manage EndpointSlices without interfering with each other, a
  <code>
    endpointslice.kubernetes.io/managed-by
  </code>
  label is used to indicate the entity
  managing an EndpointSlice. The EndpointSlice controller sets
  <code>
    endpointslice-controller.k8s.io
  </code>
  as the value for this label on all
  EndpointSlices it manages. Other entities managing EndpointSlices should also
  set a unique value for this label.
</p>
<h3 id="ownership">
  Ownership
</h3>
<p>
  In most use cases, EndpointSlices will be owned by the Service that it tracks
  endpoints for. This is indicated by an owner reference on each EndpointSlice as
  well as a
  <code>
    kubernetes.io/service-name
  </code>
  label that enables simple lookups of all
  EndpointSlices belonging to a Service.
</p>
<h2 id="endpointslice-controller">
  EndpointSlice Controller
</h2>
<p>
  The EndpointSlice controller watches Services and Pods to ensure corresponding
  EndpointSlices are up to date. The controller will manage EndpointSlices for
  every Service with a selector specified. These will represent the IPs of Pods
  matching the Service selector.
</p>
<h3 id="size-of-endpointslices">
  Size of EndpointSlices
</h3>
<p>
  By default, EndpointSlices are limited to a size of 100 endpoints each. You can
  configure this with the
  <code>
    --max-endpoints-per-slice
  </code>
  <a class='glossary-tooltip' href='/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-controller-manager/' target='_blank'>
    kube-controller-manager
    <span class='tooltip-text'>
      Control Plane component that runs controller processes.
    </span>
  </a>
  flag up to
  a maximum of 1000.
</p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-endpointslices">
  Distribution of EndpointSlices
</h3>
<p>
  Each EndpointSlice has a set of ports that applies to all endpoints within the
  resource. When named ports are used for a Service, Pods may end up with
  different target port numbers for the same named port, requiring different
  EndpointSlices. This is similar to the logic behind how subsets are grouped
  with Endpoints.
</p>
<p>
  The controller tries to fill EndpointSlices as full as possible, but does not
  actively rebalance them. The logic of the controller is fairly straightforward:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Iterate through existing EndpointSlices, remove endpoints that are no longer
    desired and update matching endpoints that have changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Iterate through EndpointSlices that have been modified in the first step and
    fill them up with any new endpoints needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there&rsquo;s still new endpoints left to add, try to fit them into a previously
    unchanged slice and/or create new ones.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Importantly, the third step prioritizes limiting EndpointSlice updates over a
  perfectly full distribution of EndpointSlices. As an example, if there are 10
  new endpoints to add and 2 EndpointSlices with room for 5 more endpoints each,
  this approach will create a new EndpointSlice instead of filling up the 2
  existing EndpointSlices. In other words, a single EndpointSlice creation is
  preferrable to multiple EndpointSlice updates.
</p>
<p>
  With kube-proxy running on each Node and watching EndpointSlices, every change
  to an EndpointSlice becomes relatively expensive since it will be transmitted to
  every Node in the cluster. This approach is intended to limit the number of
  changes that need to be sent to every Node, even if it may result with multiple
  EndpointSlices that are not full.
</p>
<p>
  In practice, this less than ideal distribution should be rare. Most changes
  processed by the EndpointSlice controller will be small enough to fit in an
  existing EndpointSlice, and if not, a new EndpointSlice is likely going to be
  necessary soon anyway. Rolling updates of Deployments also provide a natural
  repacking of EndpointSlices with all pods and their corresponding endpoints
  getting replaced.
